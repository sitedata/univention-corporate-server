<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>
The following documentation describes how to install Univention Corporate Server (UCS). The UCS system is installed from the DVD. The installation is interactive and prompts all the necessary system settings in a graphic interface.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The installation DVD is available for the computer architecture <emphasis>amd64</emphasis> (64-bit). In addition to support for the widely distributed BIOS systems, the DVD also includes support for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) standard. The UEFI support on the DVD is also capable of starting systems with activated SecureBoot and installing UCS there.
	</para>

	<para>
Following installation on hardware or in a virtualization solution, UCS can also be installed on the Amazon EC2 cloud using an AMI image. Further information can be found in <xref linkend="installation:amazonec2"/>.

	Initially, the Univention Installer attempts to configure the network interfaces automatically.
	This can be disabled by selecting the menu item <guimenuitem>Start with manual network settings</guimenuitem> from the menu of the bootloader.
	Firstly, an attempt is made to determine an IPv6 address via the stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC).
	If this is not successful, the Univention Installer attempts to request an IPv4 address via the Dynamic Host Configuration
	Protocol (DHCP). If this is successful, the manual network configuration of Univention Installer is skipped.

<section id="installation:Partitionieren_der_Festplatten">
  <title>Partitioning the hard drive</title>
  <para>
	The Univention Installer supports the partitioning of hard drives and the creation of different file systems (e.g., <systemitem class="filesystem">ext4</systemitem> and <systemitem class="filesystem">XFS</systemitem>). In addition, it is also possible to set up mechanisms such as the logical volume manager (<acronym>LVM</acronym>), <acronym>RAID</acronym> or partitions encrypted with <acronym>LUKS</acronym>.
  </para>
  <para>
	  As of UCS 4.0, the Univention Installer selects a suitable partition model (<acronym>MBR</acronym> or <acronym>GPT</acronym>) automatically depending on the size of the selected hard drive.
	  On systems with the <emphasis>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (<acronym>UEFI</acronym>)</emphasis>, the <acronym>GUID</acronym> Partition Table (<acronym>GPT</acronym>) is used automatically.
  </para>
  <para>
	The Univention Installer offers guided installations to make installation simpler. In the guided installation, certain standard schemes with respect to the partitioning and formatting are applied to the selected hard drive. In addition, it is also possible to perform partitioning manually.
  </para>
  <para>
	There are three schemes available for selection for guided partitioning:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
		<simpara>
		  <guimenu>Guided - Use entire disk</guimenu>: In this scheme, an individual partition is created for each file system. Abstraction layers like LVM are not used. During the following step the number of filesystems/partitions is assigned. The size of the partitions is restricted to
the size of the respective hard drive.
		</simpara>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
		<simpara>
		  <guimenu>Guided - Use entire disk and set up LVM</guimenu>: If the second scheme is selected, an LVM volume group is set up on the selected hard drive first. A separate logical volume is then created within the volume group for each file system. In this scheme, the size of the logical volume is restricted by the size of the volume group, which can also be subsequently enlarged with additional hard drives. In case of doubt, select this partitioning scheme.
		</simpara>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
		<simpara>
		  <guimenu>Guided - Use entire disk with encrypted LVM</guimenu>: This version is the same as the previous version, with the addition that the LVM volume group is also encrypted. Consequently, the password for the encrypted volume group has to be entered every time the system is started up.
		</simpara>

<section id="installation:textmode">
  <title>Installation in text mode</title>
  <para>
	On systems that showed a problem with the graphic variant of Univention Installer, the installation may be also started in text mode.
	To achieve this, in the DVD boot menu <guimenu>Advanced options</guimenu> the entry <guimenu>Install in text mode</guimenu> has to be selected.
  </para>
  <para>
	During installation in text mode Univention Installer shows the same information and asks for the
	same settings. After partitioning the hard drive, the system is prepared for the first boot and finally restarted.
  </para>
  <para>
	After restart the configuration may be resumed by using a web browser. The URL
	<uri>https://<replaceable>SERVER-IP-ADDRESS</replaceable></uri> or <uri>http://<replaceable>SERVER-IP-ADDRESS</replaceable></uri> has to be opened
	within the browser (HTTPS is recommended). After loading the URI a login as user
	<systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> is required.
  </para>
  <para>
	The configuration process asks for location and network setting and then resumes with the same
	steps as the graphic variant of the installation, i.e. section <emphasis>domain settings</emphasis>.

<section id="installation:amazonec2">
<title>Installation in the Amazon EC2 cloud</title>
	<para>
		Univention provides an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for the Amazon EC2
		cloud for UCS. This generic image for all UCS system roles is used to derive an individual instance
		which can be configured via the &ucsUMC; (domain name, software
		selection, etc.).
	</para>
	<para>
		The process for setting up a UCS instance based on Amazon EC2 is
		documented in the Univention Wiki <biblioref linkend="ec2-quickstart"/>.
	</para>
</section>

<section id="installation:vmware">
  <title>Installation in VMware</title>
  <para>
	If UCS is installed as a guest in VMware, the <guimenu>Linux &ar; Other Linux system</guimenu>
	option must be selected as the <guimenu>Guest operating system</guimenu> (UCS is based on Debian but
	the templates for Debian cannot be used).
  </para>

  <para>
	The Linux kernel used in UCS includes all the support drivers necessary for operation in VMware
	(<filename>vmw_balloon</filename>, <filename>vmw_pvsci</filename>, <filename>vmw_vmci</filename>, <filename>vmwgfx</filename> and <filename>vmxnet3</filename>).
  </para>

  <para>
	The open source version of the VMware Tools (Open VM Tools) is delivered with UCS. The tools can
	be installed using the <package>open-vm-tools</package> package (they are not required
	but do, for example, allow synchronization of the time on the virtualization server with the
	guest system).
  </para>
</section>

<section id="installation:docker">
  <title>Installation as Docker image</title>
  <para>
    Univention provides UCS as Docker images in the Docker Hub
	<ulink url="https://hub.docker.com/r/univention/"/>. The description of the
	Docker images explains how they can be configured.
  </para>
  <para>
	In a standard installation, the Docker images are used in a network that cannot
	be reached directly from outside the server. If multiple Docker images are used and they
	are executed on different Docker servers, a Software Defined Network or a VPN solution
	should be used.
  </para>

<section id="installation:xenserver">
<title>Installation in Citrix XenServer</title>
	<para>
		The process for setting up a UCS instance in Citrix XenServer is
		documented in the Univention Wiki <biblioref linkend="xenserver-installation"/>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To display the GRUB menu correctly, an adaption to the XenServer configuration is necessary;
	  this is described in <xref linkend="release-notes"/>.
